# Skills
#### Communication
Working with Makers Academy as part of the remote course requires incredible communication skills. Pairing with a different person everyday (who may or may not be on this continent) meant being prepared It's not just being amicable which is important, but being able to speak up and present your ideas without fear of repercussion.

#### Creativity
A lot of people assume that coding requires zero finesse or creativity to work. You just wack the 'right' code in, and you're away. I would argue that creativity is an essential skill when it comes to programming. Every challenge has multiple solutions, and it's only through creativity and exploration are these solutions going to become apparent. In regards to coding, almost all of the briefs I have worked from have been deliberately vague. However, where there is vagueness, there is potential for creativity. This tasks have gave me an excellent chance to think outside the box, and use creativity in order to get around problems that more linear workers may have found difficult. Both a degree in Film Studies and a Master's in English has given me the necessary creative skills with which I can put into practice.

#### Obsession with perfection
Doing a masters in professional writing has instilled a fixation with the correct word at the correct time. This has actually proved very useful in the coding world, as the right word and correct syntax is essential.
