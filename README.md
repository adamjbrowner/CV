# Adam Browner
A Junior Web Developer with a passion for creating complex and engaging web applications. After completely a master's in English, I discovered that my favourite kind of syntax was actually on buried inside programs, and not printed in books. After spending months learning to code in my spare time, I quit my job and dived full-time into the world of web development.

Having completed an intense 12-week bootcamp at Makers Academy, I am now looking for a role as a Junior Web Developer at a company that can accommodate my ambition and creativity.


# Skills

## Software development
+ **Languages/Technologies** - Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, PostgreSQL, NodeJS, AngularJS.  

+ **Self-driven learner** - You don't get through three years of university, one year of masters and 12 weeks of a coding bootcamp without picking up the ability to teach yourself a thing or too. Whilst part of Makers Academy, I also strived to learn new languages and technologies, even if it meant doing things the "hard" way.

+ **Creativity** - Both music and writing have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember, and both have given me invaluable skills that have transferred well into the world of coding.

+ **Dedication** - Having previously worked as a musician, I'm acutely aware that it takes a lot of dedication in order to be good at something. This has translated well into preparing for Web Development. Jumping into the world of programming wasn't easy, but with dedication I was able to progress fast, and pick up things quickly.   

+ **Communication** -
